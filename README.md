# Summary 
Currently the greatest threat to humanity is no longer nuculear disaster or famine it is climate change. There are many faults and habits that must be corrected in order to alieviate our current situation and allow nature to return to its natural flow. A possible solution which is presented in this challenge is the lithium hydrate molecule (LiH). This could be used as a new cost effective way to store and use energy. A replacement for gas and diesil based vehicles which would be cleaner and possibly longer lasting. In order to better understand LiH the group had to conduct a anylsis using various quantum algorithms and optimizers to evaluate the energy state of LiH. The group was able to complete a majority of the tasks leaving room for growth and future exploration. We look forward to presenting our findings in our Demo Day presentation and Hackathawn pitch.
